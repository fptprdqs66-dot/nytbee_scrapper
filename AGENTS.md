# AGENTS

## Scope
This file applies to the entire repository.

## Guidelines
- Keep modules small and single-purpose.
- Prefer clear, explicit naming over abbreviations.
- Document public functions and entry points with docstrings.
- When updating notebooks, ensure outputs are cleared before committing.

## Common tasks
- Install dependencies: `python -m pip install -e .`
- Lint/format: follow existing style (no enforced formatter currently).
